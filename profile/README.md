TesselStudio

Go

TesselStudio is the home of creative game development experiments, currently focused on TesselBox — a 2D sandbox adventure game built around a hexagonal grid.

Inspired by classics like Terraria and Minecraft, but reimagined with hex-based world generation, building, mining, crafting, and survival mechanics.
Current flagship project
TesselBox

A 2D sandbox adventure game inspired by Terraria, but built on a hexagonal grid.

Explore procedurally generated worlds, mine resources, build structures, craft items, fight enemies, and survive — all rendered with beautiful hexagonal tiles.
Current Status

The game is actively being rewritten in Go for better performance (world generation, physics, rendering, etc.).

    Previously: pure-Python prototype
    Now: migrating to Golang → core engine, physics, and world handling in Go
    Some features may be temporarily broken or incomplete during this refactor

We're looking for contributors, especially those with experience in:

    Game development in Go
    Networking / multiplayer (TCP-based groundwork exists)

✨ Features (Planned / In Progress)

    Hexagonal tile-based world
    Procedural world generation
    Mining, crafting & building
    Inventory & item system
    Enemies & combat
    Survival mechanics
    High-performance engine (Go rewrite)
    Potential multiplayer support (early TCP experiments)
